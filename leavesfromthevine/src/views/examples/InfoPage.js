                  Some types of tea are White, Yellow, Green, Oolong, Black and Dark (post-fermented).
                  Even though the come from the same plant, they are produced differently and their identity corresponds
                  to the wiltedness and oxygenation of their leaves. Tea that is not made from Camellia sinensis leaves is called
                  herbal tea, which uses infusions of fruit and other parts of a plant. Some people believe herbal tea is not really
                  tea, while others take it to be another type of this fascinating beverage.

                      Tea contains a moderate amount of caffeine, which can give you the energy you need
                      when you’re feeling sluggish. People often experience the effects of caffeinated
                      tea differently, reporting a more  sustained energizing effect,
                      rather than the high and crash often associated with
                      energy-boosting beverages. This is partly due to a unique compound present in tea
                      called l-theanine, which promotes calm, relaxation, and focus.

                      Some studies have even found that tea may enhance weight loss and help fight belly fat.
                      Teas have a type of flavonoid called catechins that may boost metabolism and help your
                      body break down fats more quickly.Once you've lost weight, tea could help you keep it off
                      by preventing the metabolism slowdown that's common after dropping a few pounds.

                      The latest study on tea suggests at least a cup a day
                      may help your body cling to heart-helping “good cholesterol” as you age.
                      Previous research has suggested more tea may significantly lower the risk
                      of heart disease and stroke by reducing low-density lipoprotein, or LDL,
                      the “bad” cholesterol that can build up in arteries. Tea appears to slow
                      the natural decrease in HDL that occurs during aging, according
                      to a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

                  Tea has been very popular in the emerging market, owing to prevalence of tea culture.
                  Furthermore, growth in health awareness and increase in the disposable income has aided
                  the tea market growth. Currently, tea is the most popular manufactured drink
                  and the second most consumed beverage, second only to water. The market size value in
                  2020 for the tea industry was 14.02 billion of dollars and is expected to grow 5.5% from
                  2019 to 2025. China is one of the prominent regions in the market that accounted for a
                  sizeable share of the total market in 2019.

                  or leaves of other plants. This kind of beverage is best described as an infusion of ingredients. However, this
                  beverage is still referred to as tea by many people, so even though it is not considered a real type of tea
                  by definition it is often included in tea lists by convention.
